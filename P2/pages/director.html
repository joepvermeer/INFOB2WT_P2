    <h1>Rajkumar Hirani</h1>
    <p>Rajkumar Hirani (born 20 November 1962), also called Raju Hirani, is an Indian filmmaker, director, producer and editor known for his works in Hindi films. He is the recipient of several accolades, including three National Film Awards and eleven Filmfare Awards. Hirani is referred as one of the most successful filmmakers of Indian cinema. His movies are often lighthearted but revolve around significant societal issues with humour and emotional intelligence.<br>

      Starting his career as a film editor after passing out from FTII in editing, bad experience forced him to shift in ad films, where he made several successful ads. He edited his first film as a professional editor to Vidhu Vinod Chopra's Mission Kashmir (2000). Although Hirani wanted to make films, he took a one year break and came back with the script of Munna Bhai MBBS to Chopra to help him for financing it, and Chopra produced it himself. The film released in 2003 and became widespread critical and commercial success. It won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment and the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Film, and earned Hirani his first Filmfare Award for Best Screenplay and a nomination for the Best Director.<br>
      
      After the success of MBBS, the sequel Lage Raho Munna Bhai (2006) which was second highest grosser of the year and coming-of-age drama 3 Idiots (2009), both of them won National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment and nominated in Filmfare Award for Best Film, Best Screenplay and Best Director, won all for 3 Idiots, which was also a huge commercial success, became the highest grossing Indian film of its time. His next the science fiction religious satire PK (2014) with Aamir Khan as an alien again, the highest grossing Indian film of its time and a biography drama Sanju (2018) based on Sanjay Dutt released with critical and commercial success. Both films were nominated for Best Film, Best Director at Filmfare Awards, won Best Screenplay for PK. Domestically both films are currently the second and third highest grossing Bollywood film behind Dangal. Hirani is the founder of the production house Rajkumar Hirani Films.</p>
    <h2>Early life and education</h2>
    <p>Hirani was born on 20 November 1962 in Nagpur to a Sindhi family. His ancestors originally belong to Mehrabpur, a city now in the Naushahro Firoz District, Sindh, of Pakistan. His father Suresh Hirani ran a typing institute in Nagpur. Hirani studied at St. Francis De'Sales High School, Nagpur, Maharashtra. He did his graduation in commerce. His parents wanted him to be an engineer, but he was more keen on theatre and film.<br>

      In his college days he was involved with Hindi theatre. He had many friends in Nagpur's medical college and hence, spent much time in theater at the college. Suresh had his son's photographs taken and sent him to an acting school in Mumbai. However, Hirani could not fit in and returned to Nagpur after three days. His father then asked him to apply to the Film and Television Institute of India in Pune, but the acting course had shut down and his chances of admission to the directorial course looked slim as there were far too many applicants. Hirani opted for the film editing course, and earned a scholarship.</p>
    <h2>Style, themes and influence</h2>
    <p>Hirani's films are often based on themes which explore particularly different critical social issue like middle class aspirations, reforming, standing up for themselves, fighting for the right thing, relationships among family but with healthy humour and full of emotional quotient. Hirani is editor of all of his films, he himself admitted he enjoys editing film more than anything else. Rajeev Masand said "Like those good old-fashioned Hrishikesh Mukherjee films, Hirani's film reinforced importance of human goodness and basic niceties. Hirani has been cited one of his most favourite film, Mukherjee's Anand (1971). Munna Bhai MBBS deals with corruption of hospital and cruelty of doctors, Lage Raho Munna Bhai deals with Gandhi's thinking and reforming people with soft hearted, 3 Idiots with education system, pressure on students for marks and passion of individuals, PK with religion and superstition and Sanju on relationships and media outrage. Film critic Komal Nahta called Rajkumar Hirani a magician more than a director during reviewing Sanju. He added," He narrates the complex story of a misdirected, ignorant and foolish young man with such sensitivity that the human drama becomes quite a masterpiece of a film."<br>

      All of Hirani's films are produced by Vinod Chopra Films. He had one of Chopra's films Mission Kashmir professionally. Hirani has worked consistently with writer Abhijat Joshi since Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Hirani has often cast the same actors in his projects, particularly Sanjay Dutt, who has collaborated with Hirani on three feature films and one film which itself is based on Dutt. Aamir Khan has done two path breaking films with Hirani. Boman Irani has been there in all of Hirani's films in pivotal supporting roles.</p>
