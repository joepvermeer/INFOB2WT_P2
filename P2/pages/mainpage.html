      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Two friends are searching for their long lost companion. 
        They revisit their college days and recall the memories of their 
        friend who inspired them to think differently, even as the rest of the world called them "idiots". 
        Although the film spends much of its time wallowing in the throes of sometimes vulgar screwball comedy, 
        there is also some narrative width to the plot, which may expand the film’s appeal to some viewers.
        In particular, there is a thoughtful thematic element concerning how best to educate students and
        the current deficiencies of educational systems in general. These educational system deficiencies
        are not only present in India, but are characteristic of educational systems at all levels
        all over the world.
